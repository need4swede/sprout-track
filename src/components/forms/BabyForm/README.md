# BabyForm Component

A form component for creating and editing baby profiles in the Baby Tracker application.

## Usage

// In your component
const [showBabyForm, setShowBabyForm] = useState(false);
const [selectedBaby, setSelectedBaby] = useState<Baby | null>(null);
const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

// To open the form for creating a new baby
const handleAddBaby = () => {
  setSelectedBaby(null);
  setIsEditing(false);

// In your JSX
<BabyForm
  isOpen={showBabyForm}
  onClose={() => setShowBabyForm(false)}
  isEditing={isEditing}

    // Handle data refresh after baby is created or updated
    fetchData();
  }}

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|

## Features

- Create new baby profiles
- Edit existing baby profiles
- Set warning times for feeding and diaper changes
- Mark babies as inactive (when editing)
- Form validation for required fields
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## Implementation Details

The BabyForm component uses the FormPage component from the UI library to create a full-screen form that slides in from the right side of the screen. It includes:

- A header with a title and description
- A form with fields for the baby's information
- A footer with action buttons

The component handles form submission by making API calls to the `/api/baby` endpoint with the appropriate HTTP method (POST for creating, PUT for updating).

## Styling

The component uses the following styling approaches:
- TailwindCSS for responsive layout and styling
- Form-specific styles defined in `baby-form.styles.ts`
- Consistent with the application's design system

## Accessibility

- Proper form labels for all input fields
- Required field validation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management when the form opens and closes
